## Database search with predicted structures

Now that we have our high-confidence predicted structure, we can use it to search a large database of annotated structures.
 
Similar annotated structures could provide a hypothesis about the likely function of our target protein.


### Download structure predictions

1. Download the `sample0_alphafold2.pdb` file located in the `output/alphafold2/standard/sample0/` directory. You can find the file by navigating to the `output/alphafold2/standard/sample0/` directory in the VS-code file browser on the left-hand panel.

2. Right-click the `sample0_alphafold2.pdb` file and select `Download`.


### Foldseek

The [Foldseek server](https://search.foldseek.com/search) is extremely fast and useful for identifying structural matches across a range of experimental and predicted structure databases.

> ## Careful

> When deciding to send data to an external service, it is important to understand:
> - How the data will be handled (e.g. transferred, processed, stored, secured), and
> - If it is appropriate to submit the data to the service you are intending to use.
>
> Do not send sensitive data to an external service without understanding potential risks.

Upload our predicted PDB structure to the Foldseek server and search for similar structures. Ensure that the check-boxes for all databases are selected (see screenshot below).

## SPfast 
[SPfast](https://colab.research.google.com/github/tlitfin/SPfast/blob/main/notebooks/SPfast_AFDB_clusters_PFAM.ipynb) is an alternative strategy for structure-based search and provides a minimal set of hits based on non-redundant PFAM clan annotations.

1. Upload our predicted PDB structure by **leaving the input fields blank.** 
2. Select **Run all** to execute search for annotated structures using SPfast.
3. **Wait ~3 minutes** for the file upload prompt to appear under the 3rd cell and upload your predicted structure (`sample0_alphafold2.pdb`).
4. SPfast will take about ~7 minutes after uploading the query structure.

## Synteny

T3SS genes are often found in operons.

Return to our original [assembly](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/LN879502.1) and look at the gene neighbors of our target locus (PNK_0205).

PNK_0205 is between the **SctL** and **SctJ** genes which are also components of the T3SS machinery.

In genomes where it is annotated, **SctK** is overwhelmingly found between **SctL** and **SctJ**.

The gene neighborhood of our uncharacterised gene is consistent with our protein structure based annotation.
