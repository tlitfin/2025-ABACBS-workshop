exercises: 15
questions:
objectives:
- Run nfcore/proteinfold Nextflow workflow on Setonix.
- Monitor resource allocation and utilisation.
- Evaluate the cost of execution.
keypoints:
- Nextflow can be used to orchestrate AlphaFold2 executions.
- We can monitor resource utilisation by connecting to a worker node.
- Running AlphaFold2 in split mode can significantly reduce SU consumption.

## Prepare samplesheet

We have prepared a Nextflow samplesheet containing our protein input in FASTA format. 

Each prediction must be given a unique `id` and an input file containing the target `sequence`

```bash
cat samplesheet.csv
```

Output:
``` csv
id,fasta
sample0,fasta/PNK_0205.fasta
```

## Standard run

This is the structure of a standard proteinfold workflow execution:

<p align="center">

</p>

1. Execute the workflow using the script below:

    ~~~ bash
    nextflow run nf-core/proteinfold/ \
        --input samplesheet.csv \
        --outdir output/ \
        --db /scratch/references/abacbs2025/databases/ \
        --mode alphafold2 \
        --use_gpu \
        --alphafold2_mode "standard" \
        -c abacbs_profile.config \
        --slurm_account $PAWSEY_PROJECT \
        -r 53a1008
    ~~~


## Job monitoring

1. Open a new VScode terminal using the `+` in the top-right corner of the terminal panel.

    ![](../assets/img/abacbs-new-terminal.png)

2. In our second terminal we can confirm that our job is running with:

    ```bash
    squeue --me
    ```
    ~~~
    JOBID        USER ACCOUNT                   NAME EXEC_HOST ST     REASON START_TIME       END_TIME  TIME_LEFT NODES   PRIORITY       QOS
    34776177  tlitfin pawsey1017-gpu  nf-NFCORE_PROT nid002166  R       None 08:15:36         20:15:36   11:36:58     1      75399    normal
    ~~~

3. Similarly, we can connect to the node that is executing the job to check the status (ie the node id under EXEC_HOST).
Replace <node> with the id under EXEC_HOST (eg nid002166 from the example above).

    ```bash
    ssh <node>
    ```

4. Type `yes` when prompted and then enter your workshop account password at the password prompt. **Note: you can only connect to nodes where you have an active job running**

    ```bash
    watch rocm-smi
    ```

5. We can monitor GPU utilization in the last column:

### Job Accounting

1. After the workflow has completed, view the `execution_timeline` HTML file located in the `output/pipeline_info/` directory.

2. You can find the file by navigating to the `exercises/exercise2/output/pipeline_info/` directory in the `VSCode` file browser in the left-hand panel

3. Right-click the `execution_timeline` file and select `Preview`.

## Split MSA run

Recall that AlphaFold2 relies on generating an MSA by searching large sequence databases.

This search process does not invoke the GPU which means that it is wasteful to request a GPU node until the MSA has been generated.

We can split AlphaFold2 into a part that requires the **CPU** and a part that requires the **GPU**. Nextflow can send jobs to the appropriate resource.

</p>

1. Re-run proteinfold to predict the same protein but this time use AlphaFold2 in `"split_msa_prediction"` mode:

    ~~~ bash
    nextflow run nf-core/proteinfold \
        --input samplesheet.csv \
        --outdir output-split/ \
        --db /scratch/references/abacbs2025/databases/ \
        --mode alphafold2 \
        --use_gpu \
        --alphafold2_mode "split_msa_prediction" \
        -c abacbs_profile.config \
        --slurm_account $PAWSEY_PROJECT \
        -r 53a1008
    ~~~
